    <u><p class="anim">INTRODUCTION</p></u>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is an approach to make a computer, a robot, or a product to think how smart human think.
         And finally this study outputs intelligent software systems. 
         The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge. 
         For example, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.</p>

<DIV><u><p class="anim">What is AI?</p></u>

    <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
       Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
       As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.
       In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.
